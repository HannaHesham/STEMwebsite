    <p>My experience with STEM is really great,before STEM I had a very small idea about creating a website now I can create my own website,at first it will seem hard but when you see the results you will feel great .STEM program doesn't stop here it also help you to make new friends and know new people . I'm really proud that I took this experience and I think that you should try it too.

     <p>As this is my first time joining a program, I should say: this is a never miss experience! Vodafone's STEM program exposed me to so much more than I could have imagined in such a limited time, i experienced new things, and learned so much on different levels.</p>

      <ul>
      <br>
       <li>Technical level:</li>
  <br>
    <p> Basically I've seen another side of the technology! I was introduced to what I thought never existed. Our coaches were able to explain the concept of coding to me, from the basics , to the complex elements that we don't even have to use. I learned 3 new technical languages <strong>( HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT)</strong> I found meaning and excitement in them. We were taken on the journey of website creation, the process of using HTML to create the content, the CSS to design and give life to the website, and finally JAVASCRIPT to animate!  By the end of this program, I am able to look at a page full of codes and tags yet understand what they mean, and already have an idea on what the website might look like.</p>
